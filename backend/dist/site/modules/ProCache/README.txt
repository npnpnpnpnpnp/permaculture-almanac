ABOUT PROCACHE
==============

ProCache provides the ultimate performance for your website by 
completely bypassing PHP and MySQL and enabling your web server to 
deliver pages of your ProcessWire site as if they were static HTML 
files. 

The performance benefits are major and visible. Using ApacheBench with 
the homepage of the Skyscrapers site profile, we completed 500 requests 
(10 concurrent) to the homepage. The amount of time occupied to 
complete each of these was as follows:

  * 29 seconds: no cache enabled
  * 6 seconds: built-in cache enabled
  * 0.017 seconds: ProCache enabled

These are typical results. As you can see, the performance benefits are
huge. ProCache gives you the ability to drastically reduce server 
resources and exponentially increase the amount of traffic your server
could handle. This is especially useful for traffic spikes. 

Beyond measurements, ProCache makes your website feel faster to users,
respond faster to search spiders (which can help with SEO), and helps
to conserve server resources for requests that actually need PHP and
MySQL. ProcessWire is already very fast, and not everybody necessarily 
needs what ProCache delivers. But regardless of whether you need it or
not, there is little doubt that you can benefit greatly from ProCache. 


REQUIREMENTS
============

  * ProcessWire 2.7.3 or newer (ProCache 3.0)
  * ProcessWire 2.5.3 or newer (ProCache 2.0)
  * Apache web server or 100% compatible


BEFORE INSTALLING
=================

ProCache changes the way your website delivers pages. While it is both
safe and easily reversible, make sure you have a full backup of your 
website before installing ProCache.

ProCache writes to your .htaccess file. It also removes any changes it
makes if you uninstall ProCache. However, for good housekeeping, we 
recommend you also backup your .htaccess file if you have modified it 
from the default ProcessWire htaccess file. 


HOW TO INSTALL
==============

1. Copy the ProCache files into this directory: /site/modules/ProCache/ 
2. In your ProcessWire admin, go to Modules and "Check for new modules".
3. Click "Install" for the ProCache module. 
4. Enter your license key in the field provided and 'submit'.
5. Go to Setup > Pro Cache and configure your Pro Cache settings. 


USING PROCACHE
==============

ProCache is never running when you are logged-in, so you'll want to 
test the results from another browser, or after logging out. 

After making changes on the ProCache configuration screen, if you don't
see your changes reflected on the front-end of your site, be sure to 
clear the cache. 

If you want to verify what pages are being cached, turn on the test/debug
mode from the ProCache module config screen. This will make it add a line
of text before your closing </body> tag indicating when the page was 
cached. You will only see it on a cached page. If you know a page should
be cached and you don't see it, 1) make sure you aren't logged in; 
2) hit 'reload' in your browser; 3) if you haven't cleared the cache since
enabling test/debug mode, clear it. 

If you are testing on localhost, or on another server where you have
multiple ProcessWire installations, this may prevent ProCache from 
delivering cached pages to you. Clear your cookies, specifically one
called "wire_challenge" and that should fix it. 

ProCache can be used in combination with other caches, such as the built-in
Page caching that you set per-template in the template editor. However, 
there isn't necessarily a reason to keep using it when you are using
ProCache. To reduce confusion, we recommend you stop using the built-in
page caching features when you are using ProCache. However, if you are 
currently using MarkupCache, you should continue to do so. 


PROCACHE MAINTENANCE
====================

ProCache runs a maintenance task every 30-60 seconds to remove expired 
cache files. However, this maintenance is dependent upon the occurrence 
of non-cached pageviews. Since ProcessWire itself never actually runs 
when a cached page is displayed, it doesn't have the opportunity to run 
maintenance tasks. Most sites have some cached pages and some uncached 
pages, so this is not an issue. However, if most of your site's pages
are cached, you should add a cron job to trigger maintenance. Otherwise
your cached pages may never expire. Likewise, even if you just want high 
accuracy with regard to when cache files are expired, you should add a 
cron job to trigger maintenance.

Your cron job should execute the following command every minute:

   curl --data "procache=maintenance" http://domain.com/ > /dev/null

Replace "domain.com" above with your ProcessWire-powered site's URL,
including the trailing slash (and subdirectory, if applicable). 

Set this command to execute every minute or so. If you aren't too 
worried about being exact, every 5 minutes should also be fine. 


PROCACHE FROM THE API
=====================

ProCache provides a few public methods that you may use from the API
side if you find it useful to do so. First, you'd want to have a copy
of ProCache to call methods from:

   $cache = wire('modules')->get('ProCache');

You may execute the following commands from it: 

   // Manually clear the entire cache
   $cache->clearAll();

   // Manually clear the cache for a page
   $cache->clearPage($page); 

   // Return the number of cached pages
   $n = $cache->numCachedPages();

   // Is the given page cached? Returns false if not, or array of 
   // page info if yes: array('/path/to/page' => 'date cached') 
   $info = $cache->pageInfo($page);


CACHING OTHER CONTENT TYPES
===========================
As of version 2.0.2 of ProCache and version 2.5.26 of ProcessWire, 
ProCache can cache and deliver other content types in addition html.
For example, perhaps you want to cache an XML sitemap or a JSON feed
with ProCache. 

Content types can be defined in your /site/config.php file like this:

  $config->contentTypes = array(
    'html' => 'text/html',
    'txt' => 'text/plain', 
    'json' => 'application/json',
    'xml' => 'application/xml', 
   );

The above setting represents the default as available in
/wire/config.php, so if the above is consistent with your needs 
then you do not need to set it up in /site/config.php.*

If you do modify it, you may add as many other content types as you'd 
like. The array keys should represent the file extension defined by 
an Apache mime-type. The array values represent the content type 
header that ProcessWire sends before outputting the page. 

Each template has one of the defined content types specified for it.
This is specified by editing a template in the admin, by going to:
Setup > Templates > [any-template] > Files > Content Types. Select
which content type the template should output. If nothing is selected
then PHP's default "text/html" content type is used. 


*Note that ProCache only uses the file extensions (array keys). In 
using those file extensions for the physical cache files, Apache 
recognizes them and sends the appropriate content-type headers 
just as ProcessWire does. This is what enables you to cache non-HTML 
content with ProCache, despite the fact that PHP is never loaded 
when the cached output is delivered. 


TROUBLESHOOTING CACHE ISSUES
============================

If the cache does not appear to be working: 

  1. Make sure you are not logged in to ProcessWire, as the cache is always 
     disabled when you are logged in. 
     
  2. If you have been logged in recently, sometimes certain cookies
     will still be present that prevent caching. Try testing from 
     a new Incognito (Private Mode) browser window.
     
  3. Some servers need the server DOCUMENT ROOT to be specified manually
     in the .htaccess file. But ProCache has a setting to manage it for you.  	
     In your admin, go to Setup > ProCache > Origin and scroll to the bottom
     where you will see a field called “Server document root path”. This 
     represents the server’s path to the domain/host. Enter the server path
     here and save. ProCache will update your .htaccess file, or it will ask
     you to make an update. 
     
  4. If step 3 didn’t solve it, it’s possible that your server has a document
     root path that is aliased or otherwise hidden. You may need to get this 
     information from your web host. Or, if you have shell/SSH access to the
     account, you can login, “cd” to your web root, and type “pwd” and enter.
     It should reveal the actual document root path. Copy and paste into the
     ProCache setting. 
     

JS/CSS/SCSS/LESS MERGE AND MINIFY FROM THE API
==============================================

Files can be merged and minified from the API, which gives you more control 
compared to using auto-detection of <link> or <script> tags. To do this, do 
not select the CSS/JS “Merge” options in the ProCache Minify tab. Instead use 
the built-in API methods for JS, CSS, or both; described below. 

SCSS and LESS files are automatically compiled and may be substituted for any 
CSS file mentioned here. The $procache->css() and $procache->js() methods 
output the minified filename. Pass them an array or CSV string of 
URLs/filenames to merge and minify:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= $procache->css(
    [
      'styles/a.css', 
      'styles/b.scss', 
      'styles/c.less'
    ]
  ) ?>">
  
  <script src="<?= $procache->js(
    [
      'scripts/a.js', 
      'scripts/b.js'
    ]
  ]) ?>"></script>
  
The following is the same as above, but using a CSV string for the list 
of files, rather than an array:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= $procache->css('styles/a.css, styles/b.scss, styles/c.less') ?>">
  <script src="<?= $procache->js('scripts/a.js, scripts/b.js') ?>"></script>
  
The link() and script() methods work the same as the css() and js() 
methods, except that they output the entire <link> or <script> tag, 
which might save you a step:

  <?= $procache->link("styles/a.css, styles/b.scss, styles/c.less") ?>
  <?= $procache->script("scripts/a.js, scripts/b.js") ?>
  
Provided files may be a CSV string of file URLs or an array of file 
URLs. File URLs that do not begin with a slash "/" are assumed to be 
relative to /site/templates/. Avoid different combinations of files 
depending on the page/template, as this will create multiple minified 
files with potentially redundant content. If you need files to be 
added in some cases and not others, then use a completely separate 
call for those files.
